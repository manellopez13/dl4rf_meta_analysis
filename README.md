# Deep learning for acute rib fracture detection, a systematic review and meta-analysis

This repo contains the data and scripts used to generate the forest plots in our article.

### f1_simulation

This Jupyter Notebook was used to generate the F1-scores of studies S10 and S12 with Monte Carlo simulations.

### meta_analysis

This R script is an adaptation of metafor functions to generate our forest plots for the sensitivity, the precision and the F1-scores (including simulated data) of the studies.
